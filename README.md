# Intelligent Driver Model on Straight Road 
The well-known Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) proposed by Martin Treiber et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002177). 

**Keywords:** Straight road, bottleneck, stop-and-go waves

## Version
**v1:** A preliminary framework that allows for further extension.

**v2:** Straight road with a deceleration bottleneck, resulting in a stop-and-go wave.

Bottleneck: At the end of the road, a mandatory deceleration segment was introduced as a bottleneck, which triggered stop-and-go traffic.

Driving noise: A random noise was added to (the driver's perception of) relative speed
